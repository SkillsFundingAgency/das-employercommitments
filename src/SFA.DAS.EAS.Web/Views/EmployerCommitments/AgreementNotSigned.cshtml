                doesn't have a signed agreement with the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). Without a signed agreement you can add apprentice details, but won't be able to authorise payments to training providers.

                Only account owners can sign ESFA agreements. If you're not sure who the owner is, you can <a href="@Url.ExternalUrlAction("teams", "view")">check your team details</a>.
